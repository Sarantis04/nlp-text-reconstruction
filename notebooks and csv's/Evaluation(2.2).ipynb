However, the updates were somewhat confusing, as they did not seem to include the full feedback from the reviewer or perhaps the editor.Still, I believe the team — despite some delays and less communication in recent days — truly gave their best effort for both the paper and our collaboration. We should all be grateful for the acceptance and for everyone’s hard work, especially since the paper finally appeared on SpringerLink last week.Could you also kindly remind me if the doctor still plans to edit the acknowledgments section before sending the final version? I didn’t see that part completed yet — or perhaps I overlooked it; if so, my apologies.In any case, let’s make sure everything is finalized, stay safe, and celebrate this outcome together with strong coffee and new goals for the future.\"\n",
